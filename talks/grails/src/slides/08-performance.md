## Performance

Functional tests are slow. There are lots of moving pieces.

Coping strategies:

1. Pick your tests wisely
2. Group tests into functional areas
3. Use raw HTTP and HTML scraping
4. Parallelize

## Parallelization

Managing parallel tests against one app is difficult.

Instead, group the tests and use multiple app instances.
