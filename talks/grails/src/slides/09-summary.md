# Summaryâ€¦

## Grails Functional Tests

Higher cost, higher value.

If you be smart, you can reduce the cost without reducing the value.

1. Care for your tests (e.g. Page Objects)
2. Setup a quick dev cycle (e.g `functional-test-development` plugin)
3. Start each test with a baseline state (e.g. DB Scrubber)
4. Put effort into fixture builders
5. Use a grey box strategy
6. Use remote browsers for cross platform testing
7. Parallelize by having multiple app instances
